# 2022

This year I wrote my solutions as contracts for the Hitman World of Assassination Trilogy games.

These games offer the option to create custom missions (contracts), where you can define your own objectives in any of the existing levels.

The usual method to create custom contracts, through the in-game contract creation, is quite limited. Players are only allowed to set up to 5 different kill targets with optionally some restrictions for the kills, plus a choice of some simple pre-defined "complications", such as a time limit, only allowing a specific exit point, failing the mission when you miss a shot or change disguises, etc..

The contract system is capable of much more complex objectives, but those can only be used in the game through installing mods that alter the game files, or connecting to a custom server such as [LocalGhost](https://gitlab.com/grappigegovert/localghost) or [Peacock](https://github.com/thepeacockproject/Peacock).

I have tested these contracts with Hitman 2, connected to a local LocalGhost instance.
